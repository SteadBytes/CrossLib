# CrossLib

## `crosslib-core`

Provides the core functionality of CrossLib. It is not intended to be used
directly by end users; a specific CrossLib package will be available for each
supported platform.

## Usage

```rust
use crosslib_core::{IDGenerator};

let seed = [
    0x0, 0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, 0x6, 0x7, 0x8, 0x9, 0xa, 0xb, 0xc, 0xd, 0xe, 0xf, 0x10,
    0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18, 0x19, 0x1a, 0x1b, 0x1c, 0x1d, 0x1e,
    0x1f,
];
let max_iterations = 10;

let gen = IDGenerator::new(seed, max_iterations);

for rand_id in gen {
  println!("{}", rand_id);
}
```
